## Figure Captions

### Figure 1

**LaTeX:**
```
Study area and vegetation sampling plots in south-central Bhutan (Sarpang District). 
Green polygons indicate unmanaged forest areas and black points represent sampled 
vegetation plots along the elevational gradient.

### Figure 2

**LaTeX:**
```
Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordinations of vegetation plots for four 
strata: (A) trees, (B) shrubs, (C) herbs and (D) regeneration. Points represent 
sample plots coloured by forest type; polygons delineate convex hulls for each 
forest type. Red arrows indicate fitted environmental vectors significant at 
p < 0.05 based on 999 permutations. Stress values are shown for each ordination.

### Figure 3

**LaTeX:**
```
Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) biplots for (A) trees, (B) shrubs, 
(C) herbs and (D) regeneration. Points represent plots and arrows denote 
environmental predictors retained after variance inflation factor screening 
(threshold = 10). Arrow length indicates the strength of correlations with 
ordination axes.

### Figure 4

**LaTeX:**
```
Alpha-diversity metrics across vegetation strata. Panels show (A) species 
richness, (B) Shannon diversity (H'), (C) Simpson diversity (1 - D) and 
(D) Pielou's evenness (J). Boxplots depict medians and interquartile ranges; 
points represent individual plots.

Sample-based species accumulation curves for herbs, regeneration, shrubs and 
trees. Solid lines indicate mean richness across random permutations; shaded 
envelopes show 95% confidence intervals.

herbs, regeneration, shrubs and trees. Curves represent locally weighted 
regression fits with 95% confidence bands.

### Figure 7

**LaTeX:**
```
Random-forest variable-importance ranking for predictors of regeneration 
richness. Bars show percentage increase in mean squared error (%IncMSE) 
following permutation of each variable during five-fold cross-validation. 
Higher values indicate stronger influence on predictive accuracy.
