**Figure 1.** Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordination of
vegetation plots for four strata (trees, shrubs, herbs, regeneration).
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, k = 2. Red arrows indicate significant
environmental vectors (envfit, p < 0.05, 999 permutations).

**Figure 2.** Alpha diversity indices across vegetation strata.
(A) Species richness, (B) Shannon-Wiener diversity (H'),
(C) Simpson's index (1-D), (D) Pielou's evenness (J).

**Figure 3.** Species accumulation curves (random method, 100
permutations) showing cumulative species richness as a function
of sampling effort for each vegetation stratum.

**Figure 4.** Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) biplots for
four vegetation strata. Environmental predictors selected after VIF
screening (threshold = 10). Significance tested with 999 permutations.

**Figure 5.** Random Forest variable importance for regeneration
richness prediction. Top 10 predictors ranked by percentage increase
in mean squared error (%IncMSE).

**Figure 6.** Species richness along the elevational gradient for each
vegetation stratum. LOESS smoothing applied.
