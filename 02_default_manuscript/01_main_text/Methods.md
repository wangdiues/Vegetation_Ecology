Materials and Methods
Study Area
The study was conducted in unmanaged forests of Sarpang District, south-central Bhutan, within the jurisdiction of the Sarpang Forest Division. The region spans a strong altitudinal gradient from approximately 153 to 3,500 m a.s.l., encompassing subtropical broadleaved (100–500 m), warm broadleaved (500–1,500 m), and cool broadleaved forests (1,500–3,000 m). Annual precipitation ranges from 3,500–5,500 mm, driven by monsoonal circulation and orographic uplift, while steep terrain generates pronounced microclimatic heterogeneity. The landscape forms a strategic ecological link among Bhutan’s protected areas and Biological Corridor-03, although most sampled forests remain outside formal management regimes.
Sampling Design
Vegetation sampling followed a stratified random design along the elevational gradient from Shershong (~260 m) in the south to Singye (~1,964 m) in the north. A total of 221 plots were established across forest types. Each plot measured 20 × 20 m (400 m²), with a nested 2 × 2 m subplot used to survey herbaceous vegetation. Fieldwork was undertaken between March and November to capture seasonal variation while avoiding peak monsoon inaccessibility.
Vegetation Data Collection
All free-standing woody stems with DBH > 1 cm and height > 1.3 m were recorded. DBH was measured using diameter tapes and tree height with hypsometers. Shrubs were assessed for presence, height, and lateral spread, whereas herbs were quantified using percent cover, frequency, and maximum height. Species identifications were verified with regional floras and herbarium material. Structural descriptors—basal area, DBH-class, and height-class distributions—were derived to characterize stand structure and regeneration dynamics.
Environmental Variables
Topographic attributes (elevation, slope, aspect) were recorded in the field using GPS receivers, clinometers, and compasses. Spatial climatic surfaces for temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and water balance were extracted from national-scale interpolation models and matched to plot coordinates. Digital elevation data from ASTER DEM were used to derive terrain predictors incorporated into statistical analyses.
Data Preparation
Field records were curated in tabular form to compute species abundance, frequency, basal area, and Importance Value Index (IVI) for each vegetation stratum. Alpha diversity was quantified using Shannon–Wiener diversity (H′), Simpson’s index (1–D), and Pielou’s evenness (J) for each forest type and vegetation layer .
Multivariate Community Analyses
Floristic variation among plots was examined using Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarities. Species–environment relationships were assessed with Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) using climatic and topographic predictors. Ordination axes were interpreted through Pearson and Kendall rank correlations between species scores and environmental variables.
Vegetation communities were delineated by hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and solution robustness was evaluated using Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM). Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) identified taxa significantly associated with forest types at α = 0.05. Sampling adequacy and dominance patterns were assessed through species-area curves and rank–abundance distributions .
Regeneration Dynamics and Predictive Modelling
Seedling and sapling data were analysed to quantify regeneration patterns and spatial structure. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) was applied to map recruitment hotspots across the landscape. Environmental drivers of regeneration density were modelled using Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms, with predictor importance evaluated via gain, cover, and mean-decrease-accuracy metrics. Model performance was assessed using mean squared error (MSE) and out-of-bag error rates. K-means clustering was used to classify plots into regeneration zones representing contrasting environmental regimes and recruitment intensity.
Software Environment
All analyses were conducted in R version 4.2.2, with community-ecology workflows implemented primarily through the vegan package. Multivariate classification and indicator-species procedures were cross-checked in PC-ORD v5, and spreadsheet software was used for initial data curation and quality control.
Reproducibility and Data Stewardship
Reproducibility was ensured by archiving raw field data, spatial environmental layers, curated datasets, and derived analytical outputs; documenting all distance measures, clustering criteria, ordination settings, and machine-learning parameters; and recording software versions. Intermediate products—including ordination scores, cluster assignments, regeneration surfaces, and variable-importance tables—were retained to permit independent replication and re-analysis of vegetation patterns and regeneration models.
