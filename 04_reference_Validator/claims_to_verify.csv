CLM_0001,p10,"Because temperature, moisture availability, and growing-season length vary predictably with altitude, mountain systems have long served as test beds for ecological theory addressing species richness, environmental filtering, and community turnover (Lomolino 2001; Rahbek 2005).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0002,p10,"Across regions, richness–elevation relationships are frequently unimodal but vary with spatial extent, taxonomic scope, and climatic context, indicating that no single mechanism universally governs elevational diversity patterns (Grytnes 2003; McCain 2009).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0003,p15,Such steep altitudinal transitions typify Himalayan landscapes and generate strong climatic and edaphic gradients over short distances (Grytnes & Vetaas 2002; Körner 2007).,needs_manual_review,
CLM_0004,p16,"Annual precipitation is high and strongly seasonal, reflecting monsoon circulation intensified by orographic uplift, a defining feature of the eastern Himalayan foothills (Bookhagen & Burbank 2010).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0005,p16,"Rugged terrain and variable slope exposure create pronounced microclimatic heterogeneity, which is expected to contribute to high beta diversity and fine-scale community turnover along the gradient (Grytnes & Vetaas 2002).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0006,p23,"Species identifications were verified using regional floras and herbarium reference material, and taxonomic nomenclature was cross-checked against the World Flora Online database (accessed 6 February 2026).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0007,p26,(2020)).,needs_manual_review,
CLM_0008,p26,"Terrain–climate coupling in montane systems is widely recognized as a dominant driver of vegetation turnover along elevational gradients (Grytnes & Vetaas, 2002; Körner, 2007).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0009,p27,"(2025), developed by CSIRO and distributed with a permanent digital object identifier (https://doi.org/10.25919/pec2-hs50).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0010,p29,"Alpha diversity was quantified using the Shannon–Wiener index (H′), Simpson’s diversity index (1 – D) and Pielou’s evenness (J) for each forest type and vegetation layer (Shannon 1948; Simpson 1949; Pielou 1966).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0011,p31,Floristic variation among plots was examined using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarities (Bray and Curtis 1957; Kruskal 1964).,needs_manual_review,
CLM_0012,p31,"Species–environment relationships were assessed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), which constrains ordination axes by linear combinations of climatic and topographic predictors (ter Braak 1986).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0013,p32,Community differences among forest types were tested using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA; Anderson 2001).,needs_manual_review,
CLM_0014,p34,"Indicator species analysis was applied to identify taxa significantly associated with forest types using the indicator value method, with significance assessed at α = 0.05 and 999 permutations (Dufrêne and Legendre 1997).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0015,p36,"Environmental drivers of regeneration richness were modelled using random forest and extreme gradient boosting algorithms, both of which are widely applied for non-linear ecological prediction problems (Breiman 2001; (Chen & Guestrin 2016).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0016,p39,"Community-ecology workflows, including ordination, dissimilarity-based testing and indicator-species analysis, were implemented primarily using functions described in the ecological literature underlying widely adopted multivariate methods (ter Braak 1986; Anderson 2001; Dufrêne and Legendre 1997).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0017,p45,"Stress values were uniformly low (trees = 0.0001; shrubs = 0.070; herbs = 0.001; regeneration = 0.0006), indicating excellent two-dimensional representation of Bray–Curtis dissimilarities (Appendix S3).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0018,p47,"These stratified responses mirror patterns previously documented along elevational gradients in Bhutanese forests, where understorey layers show stronger compositional turnover than canopy trees (Wangda & Ohsawa 2006a).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0019,p51,The greater sensitivity of shrub and herb layers relative to trees is consistent with Himalayan studies showing that microclimate and topography exert stronger filtering effects on understorey communities (Wangda & Ohsawa 2006a; Grierson & Long 1983–2001).,needs_manual_review,
CLM_0020,p55,"The low proportion of constrained inertia across all strata indicates that substantial compositional variation is driven by fine-scale heterogeneity and unmeasured microhabitat factors, consistent with findings from Bhutanese mountain forests characterized by rugged terrain and localized disturbance mosaics (Wangda & Ohsawa 2006a).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0021,p58,"Such patterns are consistent with Bhutanese broadleaved forests where high canopy and herb-layer richness persist across large elevational ranges (Wangda & Ohsawa 2006a, 2006c).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0022,p59,These responses align with Himalayan studies—including Bhutan—demonstrating mid-elevation diversity maxima in woody layers and high small-scale heterogeneity in understorey communities (Wangda & Ohsawa 2006; Grytnes & Vetaas 2002).,needs_manual_review,
CLM_0023,p63,"These patterns accord with floristic zonation documented in Bhutanese mountain forests, where evergreen broadleaved species dominate lower belts and pioneer or cool-adapted taxa become more frequent upslope (Wangda & Ohsawa 2006; Grierson & Long (1983–2001)).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0024,p67,"Similar links between regeneration and local stand structure have been reported for Bhutanese montane forests across elevational gradients (Wangda & Ohsawa 2006c), although few published studies have applied machine-learning approaches to regeneration dynamics within Bhutan.",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0025,p68,"The relatively low explanatory power of all models indicates that important drivers—such as canopy openness, disturbance history, soil properties or fine-scale moisture regimes—were not fully captured by the available predictors, a common limitation in forest-regeneration modelling in complex mountain terrain (Elith, Leathwick & Hastie 2008).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0026,p71,"This pattern mirrors observations from other Himalayan forests where understorey communities closely track microclimatic and edaphic variability, whereas long-lived canopy trees integrate conditions over broader temporal and spatial scales (Wangda & Ohsawa 2006a; Grytnes & Vetaas 2002).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0027,p71,"In Bhutan, for instance, Wangda and Ohsawa (2006) found steep elevational turnover in shrub and herb layers across broadleaved forests while canopy composition remained comparatively stable, consistent with the compressed tree NMDS configuration observed here.",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0028,p71,"In our plots, shrubs and herbs showed greater between-plot dispersion than trees, likely due to patchy responses to slope position, moisture pockets, and disturbance legacies that vary sharply across Bhutan’s rugged terrain (Wangda & Ohsawa 2006).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0029,p71,"more erratic, microhabitat-driven changes in the understorey – is consistent with montane forests across the Himalaya, where overstorey composition is constrained by broad climatic envelopes while understorey communities respond flexibly to local topography and disturbance (Ohsawa 1995; Grytnes & Vetaas 2002).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0030,p73,"Such low constrained inertia is common in steep mountain systems, where unmeasured microtopographic factors – canopy gaps, soil depth, fine-scale moisture, and disturbance history – often dominate local community assembly, overwhelming the effects of macroclimatic gradients (Grytnes & Vetaas 2002; Wangda & Ohsawa 2006).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0031,p73,"Bhutanese forests in particular are characterized by abrupt changes in slope, exposure, and substrate over tens of meters, producing high species turnover within the nominal elevational belts (Grierson & Long (1983–2001)–2001; Wangda & Ohsawa 2006).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0032,p73,"Such decoupling between canopy and understorey responses has also been reported in other Himalayan gradients, where herb-layer distributions can be driven by localized canopy openings and moisture pockets rather than elevation per se (Grytnes & Vetaas 2002).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0033,p75,"Tree layers in our study maintained high species richness and evenness across the gradient, reflecting the coexistence of multiple canopy dominants in these unmanaged stands – a feature repeatedly documented in Bhutan’s warm and cool broadleaved forests (Grierson & Long (1983–2001)–2001; Wangda & Ohsawa 2006).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0034,p75,"Shrub richness peaked at mid-elevations, consistent with many Himalayan studies that find unimodal diversity curves in the woody understorey around intermediate altitudes where moisture, temperature, and structural complexity are jointly optimized (Grytnes & Vetaas 2002).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0035,p75,"Indeed, high herb-layer beta diversity is widely reported in Himalayan forests and alpine systems, where aspect, litter depth, and gap dynamics generate sharp species turnover over very short distances (Grytnes & Vetaas 2002).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0036,p77,"The associations of Schima wallichii and Castanopsis indica with low- to mid-elevations, and Alnus nepalensis with higher elevations, align closely with Bhutanese floristic syntheses: evergreen broadleaved dominants characterize lower belts, whereas cold-tolerant or disturbance-adapted taxa (including pioneers like Alnus) become increasingly prominent upslope (Grierson & Long (1983–2001)–2001; Wangda & Ohsawa 2006).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0037,p77,"These patterns support the view that Himalayan forest zonation is not defined by sharp, discrete boundaries, but rather by overlapping species distributions structured by gradual shifts in temperature, moisture, and disturbance regimes (Ohsawa 1995).",needs_manual_review,
CLM_0038,p79,"The importance of understorey structure in shaping tree regeneration echoes the conclusions of Wangda and Ohsawa (2006), who qualitatively noted that sites with well-developed shrub layers in Bhutan tended to support greater tree recruitment.",needs_manual_review,
