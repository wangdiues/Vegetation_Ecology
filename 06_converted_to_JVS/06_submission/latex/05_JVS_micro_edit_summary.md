# JVS Micro-Edit Summary

- NMDS clarification added: inserted one concise sentence in Results stating that multiple dimensional solutions were explored, stress stayed consistently low, and ordination stability was confirmed.
- Novelty softened: replaced stronger novelty wording with more conservative phrasing ("one of few multi-stratum assessments" and "comparatively uncommon").
- Indicator species conceptual link strengthened: revised Discussion to explicitly link low tree indicator specificity to broad niche amplitudes, stronger shrub/herb differentiation to fine-scale filtering, and this contrast to vertical decoupling.
- Diversity language moderated: replaced superlative framing with cautious wording emphasizing substantial compositional turnover and elevated beta diversity relative to alpha diversity.
- Spatial autocorrelation limitation added: inserted one concise sentence in Limitations noting spatial autocorrelation was not explicitly modeled, may affect fine-scale inference, and could be addressed with spatially explicit approaches.
- Sentences tightened: shortened and clarified selected long or redundant sentences in edited sections while preserving meaning.
- Confirmation no statistics were altered: all numerical values, test statistics, and reported model outputs remain unchanged.

## Consistency checks
- Build status: manuscript compiles cleanly to `01_manuscript_jvs.pdf`.
- Citations: all `\cite{}` keys resolve in `02_references.bib`.
- Bibliography integrity: no duplicate BibTeX keys detected.
- Cross-references: no broken references observed in compile log.
